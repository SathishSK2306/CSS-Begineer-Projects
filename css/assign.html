        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR was an Indian aerospace scientist
        and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to
        2007. Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he
        studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
        decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
        Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
        Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
        space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came
        to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development
        of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a
        pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
        Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
        test by India in 1974. On January 23, 2024, the president’s office
        announced that Karpoori Thakur, socialist leader and chief minister of
        the state of Bihar twice in the 1970s, will posthumously receive the
        country’s highest civilian honor. During his term as chief minister,
        Thakur worked for marginalized groups and brought in “reservations,” or
        affirmative action programs, for “other backward classes” (OBCs), a term
        used by the Indian government for groups that are educationally or
        socially marginalized. The president’s announcement came a day before
        Thakur’s birth centenary. On February 3 the president’s office and Prime
        Minister Narendra Modi announced that Lal Krishna Advani, former deputy
        prime minister of India, a founding member of the Bharatiya Janata Party
        (BJP), and a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), will be
        conferred the Bharat Ratna. Then, on February 9, the president’s office
        and the prime minister announced three more Bharat Ratna awards
        (posthumous) for the year—geneticist and administrator Monkombu
        Sambasivan Swaminathan as well as Congress leader Pamulaparti Venkata
        Narasimha Rao and independence activist and political leader Chaudhuri
        Charan Singh, both of whom were former prime ministers of India—making
        this a year when the highest number of Bharat Ratna awards have been
        declared. Swaminathan is recognized for his role in India’s green
        revolution, increasing the yield of wheat and rice in the country and
        moving India toward self-sufficiency in food production; Rao made
        efforts to liberalize India’s economy in the early 1990s; and Charan
        Singh was an independence activist who served briefly as prime minister
        from 1979 to 1980. engineering, the application of science to the
        optimum conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of humankind.
        The field has been defined by the Engineers Council for Professional
        Development, in the United States, as the creative application of
        “scientific principles to design or develop structures, machines,
        apparatus, or manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly or
        in combination; or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance
        of their design; or to forecast their behaviour under specific operating
        conditions; all as respects an intended function, economics of operation
        and safety to life and property.” The term engineering is sometimes more
        loosely defined, especially in Great Britain, as the manufacture or
        assembly of engines, machine tools, and machine parts. The words engine
        and ingenious are derived from the same Latin root, ingenerare, which
        means “to create.” The early English verb engine meant “to contrive.”
        Thus, the engines of war were devices such as catapults, floating
        bridges, and assault towers; their designer was the “engine-er,” or
        military engineer. The counterpart of the military engineer was the
        civil engineer, who applied essentially the same knowledge and skills to
        designing buildings, streets, water supplies, sewage systems, and other
        projects. Associated with engineering is a great body of special
        knowledge; preparation for professional practice involves extensive
        training in the application of that knowledge. Standards of engineering
        practice are maintained through the efforts of professional societies,
        usually organized on a national or regional basis, with all members
        acknowledging a responsibility to the public over and above
        responsibilities to their employers or to other members of their
        society. The function of the scientist is to know, while that of the
        engineer is to do. Scientists add to the store of verified systematized
        knowledge of the physical world, and engineers bring this knowledge to
        bear on practical problems. Engineering is based principally on physics,
        chemistry, and mathematics and their extensions into materials science,
        solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, transfer and rate processes,
        and systems analysis. Unlike scientists, engineers are not free to
        select the problems that interest them. They must solve problems as they
        arise, and their solutions must satisfy conflicting requirements.
        Usually, efficiency costs money, safety adds to complexity, and improved
        performance increases weight. The engineering solution is the optimum
        solution, the end result that, taking many factors into account, is most
        desirable. It may be the most reliable within a given weight limit, the
        simplest that will satisfy certain safety requirements, or the most
        efficient for a given cost. In many engineering problems the social and
        environmental costs are significant. Engineers employ two types of
        natural resources—materials and energy. Materials are useful because of
        their properties: their strength, ease of fabrication, lightness, or
        durability; their ability to insulate or conduct; their chemical,
        electrical, or acoustical properties. Important sources of energy
        include fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas), wind, sunlight,
        falling water, and nuclear fission. Since most resources are limited,
        engineers must concern themselves with the continual development of new
        resources as well as the efficient utilization of existing ones.

        Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with
        the design, development, testing, and production of aircraft,
        spacecraft, and related systems and equipment. The field has
        traditionally focused on problems related to atmospheric and space
        flight, with two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical
        engineering and astronautical engineering. Aeronautical Engineering
        focuses on the theory, technology, and practice of flight within the
        earth’s atmosphere. Astronautical Engineering focuses on the science and
        technology of spacecraft and launch vehicles. What does an aerospace
        engineer do? Aerospace engineers develop leading-edge technologies and
        integrate them into aerospace vehicle systems used for transportation,
        communications, exploration, and defense applications. This involves the
        design and manufacturing of aircraft, spacecraft, propulsion systems,
        satellites, and missiles, as well as the design and testing of aircraft
        and aerospace products, components, and subassemblies. Successful
        aerospace engineers possess in-depth skills in, and an understanding of,
        aerodynamics, materials and structures, propulsion, vehicle dynamics and
        control, and software. Where do aerospace engineers work? Aerospace
        engineers work primarily in the aerospace industry, at systems and
        software suppliers, corporate labs, government labs, and universities.
        The skill set of aerospace engineers is extremely broad and
        multidisciplinary, and the experience of aerospace engineers as systems
        architects and engineers allows them to make contributions in many
        diverse sectors. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the
        industries that employed the most aerospace engineers in 2014 were:
        Aerospace product and parts manufacturing: 38% Engineering services: 14%
        Federal government, excluding postal service: 13% Research and
        development in the physical, engineering, and life sciences: 12%
        Navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control instruments
        manufacturing: 5% In 2016, and for the fourth time in six years, Penn
        State topped the list of preferred suppliers of engineering talent to
        the aerospace and defense industry, according to the Aviation Week 2016
        Workforce Study. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median
        annual wage for aerospace engineers was $105,380 in May 2014. The median
        annual wages for aerospace engineers in the top industries in which they
        worked were as follows: Federal government, excluding postal service =
        $113,550 Navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control
        instruments manufacturing = $111,660 Research and development in the
        physical, engineering, and life sciences = $107,490 Engineering services
        = $103,450 Aerospace product and parts manufacturing = $102,430 The
        average annual starting salary for Penn State Aerospace Engineering
        2015-2016 undergraduates was $63,286.*
